# _Super Galactic Age Calculator_

_4 September 2020_

#### _A web project that calculates a user's various planet ages (for Epicodus)_

#### By _**Vanessa Stewart**_

## Description

This is a project completed for Epicodus to practice testing business logic with Jest, using webpack to bundle and lint code, running an npm to manage dependencies, and implementing ES6 features including classes and template literals, and following a Red, Green Refactor workflow during test-driven development.

The original directions are as follows:

_A_ solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. However, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. For instance, a solar year on Mercury lasts 88 days. Write an application that determines a user's age based on a planet's solar years._

_Take a person's age in years and create a class that does the following:_

* _Returns their age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)_
* _Returns their age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)_
* _Returns their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)_
* _Returns their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)_
* _Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planetâ€¦ (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user's life expectancy. You can determine average life expectancy as you see fit. A simple way to do this would be to have the user input the average life expectancy for their demographic. A more involved way to do this would be to collect other information from the user (e.g. lifestyle, country of residence, activity level, etc.) to determine their life expectancy._
* _If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy._


## Specifications
|Test #| Behavior | Input    | Output   |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Program returns user's age in Mercury years. | 31 | 129 |
| 2 | Program returns user's age in Venus years. | 31 | 50 |
| 3 | Program returns user's age in Mars years. | 31 | 16 |
| 4 | Program returns user's age in Jupiter years. | 31 | 2 |
| 5 | Given a user input of their expected life expectancy given their demographics, program returns years a user has left to live on each planet | Life Expectancy: 79; Earth Age: 31  | Mercury Years Left: 200; Venus Years Left: 77; Earth Years Left: 48; Mars Years Left: 25; Jupiter Years Left: 4;  |
| 6 | If a user, has surpassed the average life expectancy, the program returns the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.| Life Expectancy: 79; Earth Age: 100 | Mercury Years Lived Past Expectancy: 87; Venus Years Lived Past Expectancy: 33; Earth Years Lived Past Expectancy: 21; Mars Years Lived Past Expectancy: 11; Jupiter Years Lived Past Expectancy: 1;||
